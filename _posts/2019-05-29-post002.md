[下雨 - 李志](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEx-3Zzl2uU)

Instead of standing against any opinion, I prefer to keep absolute neutral. Everything exists for a reason. Then let facts speak for themselves, just as what wikipedia does. For what we are facing, this song is the best description. Nothing else is worth saying.  

FYI, I might translate the lyrics in a few days.
